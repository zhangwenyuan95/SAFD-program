# SAFD-program

This exe file needs to be run in the matlab runtime environment to ensure that matlab runtime has been installed in the computer. If not installed, it can be installed using MyAppInstaller_web.exe in the folder

The "datasets" folder contains the "images" folder and the "labels" folder. Images and labels need to be placed in the corresponding folders respectively.

train_images.txt, training_labels.txt, test_images.txt, test_labels.txt need to be consistent with the file names in the datasets.


The main program is SAFDNet_Program.exe. After running it, the list of the training set and the list of being tested will pop up. The results will be displayed after each test image is tested. After the program ends, the result will be written into result.txt, and the Ground Truth image and the predicted image will be saved in visual.
